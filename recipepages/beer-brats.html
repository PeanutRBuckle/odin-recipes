        <h1>Beer Brats</h1>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>8 Brats</li>
            <li>4-6 Cans of Beer</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop up the onion. Bigger chunks are better but its all up to your preferences. Keep in mind the chunks will shrink.

            </li>
            <li>Fill the pot you are using with beer, onions, and 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of pepper, and 1 tsp of paprika (you can add a dash of garlic or whatever if you like). As long as the pot is big enough for the brats and as long as you have enough beer to cover them you are fine.

            </li>
            <li>Bring the beer mixture to a boil.</li>

            <li>Once the beer is boiling, lower the heat to medium and add the brats. Cook for 8 minutes or so.</li>

            <li>Remove the brats and the onions. Put the onions in a bowl and cover (you will want to put these on top later).</li>

            <li>Sear the hell out of the brats at your grills highest setting. I like them nice and charred.</li>

            <li> Add onions, sauerkraut, mustard, or whatever! (Ketchup is not allowed though, that is seriously gross if you put ketchup on german style brats.)</li>
        </ol>
