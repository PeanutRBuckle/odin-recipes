        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs beef chuck</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic (can be more if you want)</li>
            <li>1 bottle Tuscan Wine (preferrably sangiovese or chianti)</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot, brown the beef on all sides for a minute or two (you might need to do this in batches so there is enough room).</li>
            <li>Add the beef and juices back to the pot (if browning in batches) and add the red wine, garlic, salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid and simmer on a medium-low heat for 1.5 hours, uncover the pot and continue to simmer the stew for another 1.5 hours until the liquid has reduced slightly.</li>
            <li>Top tip: once the stew is uncovered check it every so often and give it a stir to make sure it doesn't stick or the meat at the top dries out.</li>
            <li>The beef should be tender but not completely falling apart. Serve with creamy polenta and crusty bread. </li>
        </ol>
